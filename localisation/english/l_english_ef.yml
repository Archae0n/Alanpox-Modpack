  ef_flavour.10.name: "Into the Deep"
  ef_flavour.10.desc: "Several prominent members of [This.GetName]'s planetary administration have expressed concern over the lack of information about the state of lowest arcology levels.\n\nThey have petitioned the planetary governor to allow an expedition to venture into the deep levels and conduct a survey of the population and the state of the habitation zones."
  ef_flavour.10.a: "An excellent initiative."
  ef_flavour.10.b: "It would be too dangerous."

  ef_flavour.11.name: "Expedition: New Zones"
  ef_flavour.11.desc: "Our expedition into the deep levels of [This.GetName] has returned with remarkable news; they have encountered entire habitation units unknown to the planetary authorities. What's more they are eager to work!\n\nIt appears that the denizens of the lower levels had been constructing far more than the local governor suspected. Between natural growth and a steady flow of migrants to these new zones, the population of [This.GetName] appears to be larger than the last census would suggest."
  ef_flavour.11.a: "An unforeseen benefit."

  ef_flavour.12.name: "Expedition: Party Wipe"
  ef_flavour.12.desc: "After several months without contact we can only assume that something has gone wrong with our survey team. They have disappeared without a trace in the lower levels.\n\nWe have no way of knowing whether they got lost, ran into gangers or other more dangerous things that lurk in the deep recesses of [This.GetName].\n\nRegardless of their ultimate fate, our survey of the arcologies has been left incomplete and we continue to have major gaps in our knowledge of many of the lowest levels."

  ef_flavour.13.name: "Expedition: Collapse"
  ef_flavour.13.desc: "The survivors of our expedition into the deep levels of [This.GetName]'s arcologies have returned. They report that the expedition was making good progress until a large section of underground tunnels and residential zones collapsed.\n\nThe cause is unknown, but it could be anything from a gang war gone overboard to a sudden quake caused by the pressure of the buildings above. Regardless, it appears that this small corner of the world city is no more."
  ef_flavour.13.a: "Unfortunate."

  ef_flavour.20.desc: "Tragedy has struck [This.GetName] today as a large freighter broke up in the upper atmosphere, dropping debris and cargo throughout the Southern hemisphere of the planet.\n\nAlthough the falling wreckage has cause some damage, much of it was burned up during the descent. Casualties are relatively light, but it appears that freighter was carrying a large quantity of hazardous materials for a major research laboratory on [This.GetName]. We have no idea what the effect of these substances will be on the planet's enviroment."

Interrogations have revealed that they are members of a pre FTL civilization. They claim to have been abducted as slaves by the smugglers and shipped offworld.\n\nWe believe that we can locate their homeworld by examining the smugglers navigation data, but some of the primitives have expressed a desire to remain in our more advanced society, citing poverty and oppression back home."

  ef_flavour.60.b: "Wait and see what happens."

  ef_flavour.61.name: "Runaway Machines"
  ef_flavour.61.desc: "Chaos erupted on [This.GetName] as computer systems across the planet went haywire, causing a great deal of damage. It seems that the initial cause of the intrusion originated from a disused warehouse in the lower levels of the city.\n\nThe authorities were unable to determine the culprits, but they did discover a crude AI core, bearing significant damage. The perpetrators may have escaped, but their weapon is no longer available."
  ef_flavour.61.a: "Regrettable"

  ef_flavour.62.name: "A Failed Invention"
  ef_flavour.62.desc: "Our investigation on [This.GetName] has borne fruit. It appears that a minor criminal syndicate was attempting to develop a homegrown artificial intelligence.\n\nUnfortunately for the criminals, they were unable to achieve a fully functional intelligence. The program performed poorly and left telltale traces on public systems when used, allowing our investigators to follow the tracks.\n\nAlthough the criminal's work was shoddy, there are some novel solutions they developed that certain members of our scientific community are interested in."

  ef_trade.15.name: "An Unfortunate Downswing"
  ef_trade.15.desc: "Several recent trade reports from major conglomerates on [This.GetName] have painted a less impressive picture than expected. Worried shareholders have quickly divested their shares, prompting the whole market to move downwards. For now at least, the party has stopped."
  ef_trade.15.a: "I'm sure this is temporary."

  ef_trade.20.name: "Financial Anomalies"
  ef_trade.20.desc: "Accounting regulators on [This.GetName] have been reporting irregularities in the planetary government's balance sheets. Multiple departments have reporting higher than expected expenses while tax revenue appears to have fallen.\n\nSeveral prominent megacorporations on [This.GetName] have contributed very little to the public coffers, yet they have been reporting record profits over the last financial cycle.\n\nSomething unusual is going on."
  ef_trade.20.investigate: "We must investigate immediately."
  ef_trade.20.ignore: "It's likely nothing."

  ef_trade.21.name: "A Grand Conspiracy"
  ef_trade.21.desc: "Our investigators on [This.GetName] have uncovered evidence of a sweeping conspiracy between major corporate entities and the local government.\n\nNumerous government officials appear to have accepted bribes in exchange for issuing tax reductions or ignoring them outright.\n\nThe most prominent conspirators have been arrested, but the rot appears to have spread deep. We still have several likely leads to pursue before we get to the bottom of this criminal conspiracy."

  ef_trade.22.name: "Rotten to the Core"
  ef_trade.22.desc: "Our investigation into corruption on [This.GetName] has led to a startling revelation. [ef_corrupt_governor.GetName], the planetary governor of [This.GetName] was in collusion with the conspirators!\n\nWe have been presented with undeniable evidence of [ef_corrupt_governor.GetName]'s knowledge of the conspiracy, but it appears that [ef_corrupt_governor.GetHerHis] direct involvement was limited to accepting payments to ignore the problem.\n\nIt may be politically inconvenient to directly charge the governor and perhaps we could arrange for the whole debacle to be swept under the rug."
  ef_trade.22.imprison: "[ef_corrupt_governor.GetName] must go."

  ef_trade.23.desc: "Our ongoing anti-corruption investigation on [This.GetName] has borne fruit. We now possess a comprehensive list of the individuals and entities involved in a grand plan to defraud the planetary government.\n\nAlthough many of the conspirators have been arrested, there are several individuals involved who possess substantial political and financial connections.\n\nWe could proceed with prosecuting these conspirators, but their removal may cause a major disruption in the economy of [This.GetName]."

  ef_trade.30.desc: "A major corporation on [This.GetName] has fallen on hard times recently. One of their biggest competitors has made moves to acquire the failing megacorp, but the potential merger would result in an extremely dominant market share.\n\nSeveral of the competing megacorporations on [This.GetName] have petitioned the government to disallow the merger, claiming that it would result in a de-facto monopoly. They have quietly promised to contribute a sign of their appreciation, should we come around to their perspective."
  ef_trade.30.allow_merger: "No, the deal goes ahead."

  ef_trade.50.desc: "Irreconcilable tensions between rival corporations on [This.GetName] have boiled over, resulting in low-level warfare against one another.\n\nA string of bombings and high profile assassinations have swept over the world as various competitors maneuver to take advantage of the sudden chaos.

  ef_trade.52.desc: "The undeclared conflict between rival megacorporations on [Target.GetName] has escalated recently as a wave of bombings have swept over the world.\n\nWarehouses, factories and research facilities across the planet have been destroyed in the initial wave and the retaliation attacks that followed."

  ef_trade.53.name: "Rising Chaos on [Target.GetName]"
  ef_trade.53.desc: "[Target.GetName] has seen a recent string of high profile break-ins and kidnappings. Although primarily concentrated between the rival parties of the planet's growing corporate war, third parties have been increasingly involved.\n\nInvestors and conglomerates have begun to re-evaluate their association with [Target.GetName] in response to the authorities' apparent inability to resolve the crisis."
  ef_trade.53.a: "A worrying trend."

  ef_trade.54.name: "Breakdown of Order"
  ef_trade.54.desc: "The Shadow War on [Target.GetName] has grown completely out of hand. Large areas of the planet have descended into complete lawlessness as local authorities are forced out by heavily armed mercenary groups.

  ef_trade.55.name: "To the Victors the Spoils"
  ef_trade.55.desc: "The Shadow War on [This.GetName] has come to an end as one of the rival megacorporations has collapsed completely. Many of the surviving leadership have fled, while the corporation's assets and employed have been forcibly acquired by the victor.\n\nThe period of conflict and instability on [This.GetName] appears to have come to an end, but the damage has been done.

  ef_trade.56.desc: "Local authorities have succeeded in bringing the Shadow War on [This.GetName] to an end.

  ef_trade.60.desc: "Local authorities on [This.GetName] have, in conjunction with several of the major corporations, arranged a grand summit of local and galactic commercial partners.\n\nWith some of the biggest names in the galaxy sending at least a token representative, this conference represents an excellent opportunity to attract further investment and deals for [This.GetName]."

  ef_trade.61.a: "Marvellous news."

  ef_trade.62.name: "A Futile Effort"
  ef_trade.62.desc: "Despite the best efforts of [This.GetName]'s leadership, the trade summit has descended into a disaster.

  ef_trade.62.a: "An unfortunate outcome."

  ef_trade.70.name: "Hypercompetitive Business Practices"
  ef_trade.70.desc: "[This.GetName] is famous for its intense corporate rivalries and cutthroat business practices. However in recent months, this competition has been threatening to grow into something more sinister.\n\nNumerous warehouses and factories in the lower levels have been reporting an uptick in sabotage and mysterious break ins. Suspiciously, these incidents are confined to facilities belonging to two rival corporations.\n\nNaturally, both have blamed the other and have sought the authorities to punish the other party."
  ef_trade.70.a: "We could be 'persuaded' to a particular perspective."
  ef_trade.70.b: "It is not our role to interfere."
  ef_trade.70.c: "Crack down on this sort of behaviour."

  ef_industry.11.name: "On the Altar of Progress"

Some have even embraced biological and cybernetic enhancements, legal or not, to better cope with the hostile nature of the planet.\n\nIf we ever want this world to return to its former habitability, we have a long cleanup process ahead of us."
  ef_industry.11.a: "So be it."

  ef_industry.12.name: "The Fires of Industry"

  ef_industry.13.a: "Unfortunate"

  ef_industry.14.name: "Stash it Away"
  ef_industry.14.desc: "The local authorities on [Target.GetName] have come up with a inventive proposal to address the world's never ending hazardous waste issue.\n\nBy gathering large quantities of difficult-to-store waste materials and hauling them into orbit, we can neatly sidestep the question of where to store them. Any potential navigation hazards would be well outweighed by the benefits of this easy disposal method."
  ef_industry.14.a: "Do it."
  ef_industry.14.b: "Hold off."

  ef_industry.15.name: "Overproduction Drive"
  ef_industry.15.desc: "An unexpectedly poor twist of fortune for a local shipping conglomerate has turned into a boon for our local manufactories on [Target.GetName].\n\nA large freighter carrying exotic materials and valuable chemical ingredients has encountered a critical engine failure in orbit. Although the vessel is unable to carry its cargo on to its intended destination, many of the factories on [Target.GetName] have jumped at the chance to purchase such valuable materials at a bargain.\n\nThe resultant glut of goods has driven record production numbers this year and our industries are thriving from this windfall."
  ef_industry.15.a: "Splendid"

  ef_industry.16.name: "Natural Recycling"
  ef_industry.16.desc: "A curious biological phenomenon has emerged on [Target.GetName].\n\nAs the planet's biosphere is increasingly saturated in toxic chemicals, some forms of microbial life appear to have adapted to feed upon the artificial elements present in the environment.\n\nThese adaptable microbes have had a noticeable effect on the local environment, helping purify many of the worst contaminants and breaking them down into simpler forms."
  ef_industry.16.a: "We should fund an operation to spread them across the planet."
  ef_industry.16.b: "A fortunate occurrence."

  ef_industry.17.name: "Hungry Hungry Xenobacteria"
  ef_industry.17.desc: "Our efforts to seed colonies of waste-eating microbes across [Target.GetName] has been a spectacular success! The colonies have take to their new homes with enthusiasm and we already have reports of improved environmental conditions."
  ef_industry.17.a: "Just as planned."

  ef_industry.18.name: "Overenthusiastic Microbes"
  ef_industry.18.desc: "The waste-eating microbes that we recently spread across [Target.GetName] have been very successful at voraciously consuming the inorganic contaminants that cover the planet.\n\nUnfortunately they appear to have mutated further. The microscopic bacteria have developed a taste for the materials that make up our machinery and infrastructure too.\n\nAlthough the planetary authorities have successfully decontaminated most industrial areas of their presence, they managed to damage several important facilities across the planet."

Several poorly worded comments by local administrators have inflamed the situation.\n\nWith the workers downing tools and taking the opportunity to air their grievances, the planet's industry has ground to a halt. Without action to break the deadlock, this situation may persist for months."

  ef_industry.20.c: "Disperse the protesters by force."

  ef_industry.30.name: "Lost and Found"
  ef_industry.30.desc: "Managing interstellar supply chains is a challenging endeavor at the best of times. It appears that one of the myriad industries on [This.GetName] unintentionally over-ordered certain rare materials required as part of their production line.\n\nWith no ability to store any more resources and with the freighter unwilling to ship them back offworld, our local authorities have found themselves the unexpected owners of a large quantity of valuable materials."

  ef_industry.40.name: "Cradle to Grave"
  ef_industry.40.desc: "[This.GetName] produces an enormous quantity of starship parts and replacements.

With [This.GetName]'s artisans being considered the highest quality, a burgeoning luxury industry has quickly sprung up to meet the growing demand."

  ef_diplo.51.desc: "A standout hit from [This.GetName] has been making waves in the galactic entertainment scene. A dramatized retelling of the city world's early years, set long before it became the immense urban planet that it is today.\n\nCritics and audiences alike have acclaimed it to be one of the best instances of storytelling to come out of the §Y[This.Owner.GetName]§! in quite some time."

  ef_diplo.52.name: "Killer Xenos from Extragalactic Space"
  ef_diplo.52.desc: "The entertainment industry of [This.GetName] has had another roaring success. Their latest offering - a sensational story of aliens from beyond the galactic rim that invade and lay waste to much of the galaxy has been very well received across the galaxy, although some critics have called the plot 'contrived' and 'wholly unrealistic'.\n\nNonetheless this reflects well on the prospects of the §I[This.Owner.GetName]'s§! influence in greater galactic media."
  ef_diplo.52.a: "The premise is a bit implausible."

  ef_diplo.53.name: "Khan of the Void"
  ef_diplo.53.desc: "One of [This.GetName]'s most recent media offerings has been gathering a cult following.\n\nSet in a fictionalized version of the §Y[event_target:ef_maruader_expy_country.GetName]§!, the story follows a §Y[event_target:ef_maruader_expy_country.species.GetName]§! youth as they unite their warring clans and establish themselves as a mighty Khan.\n\nThe producers assure viewers that any resemblance to real or historical characters is §Rstrictly§! coincidental.
