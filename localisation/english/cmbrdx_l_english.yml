 cmbrdx.777.name:0 "Failed Nation"
 cmbrdx.777.desc:0 "Today by majority vote the Galactic Senate has concluded that the services of the Superstate are no longer required, and it should be disbanded. Whether or not this news can be considered great, it is undeniable that the Galaxy does not want to lose it's sovereignity and any attempts by future Superstate contenders will probably fail in a similar manner. Some consider this to be the greatest geopolitical disaster, but some argue it's a 'one step back two step forwards' situation, igniting hope and guaranteeing independence for the foreseeable future. Only time will tell if the failed Superstate will regain it's posture on the Galactic playground and become relevant again, or if a different empire will emerge as the Galaxy's sole hegemon."
 cmbrdx.777.a:0 "The tragedy..."
 cmbrdx.777.b:0 "Serves them right!"

 cmbrdx.001.desc:0 "The Galaxy long yearned for a protector that would defend it with extreme vigilance and dedication. The recently proclaimed Zenith Empire considers itself to be a worthy unyielding protector of all sentient beings, both organic and synthetic.\n\nSome species rejoice in these news, the others heavily oppose the idea, preferring to maintain their own sovereignity over dedicated protectors. The Zenith Emperor Protector has promised that each enemy will face retribution but only time will tell if these promises of freedom and justice are the actual intentions of the Empire, or they merely desire for greater control.\n\nBut one fact is certain, even though the combined strength of the entire galaxy is stunning, the Zenith Empire is impeding."

Through many trials and tribulations, the Custodian has become the new ruler of the galaxy.\n\nThe reformed community will be lead through the turbulent future by the new Banana Chancellor, and soon, all will be prosperous.\n\nBut seriously, was it really worth it? Because let's be honest, we all know that you're the only person to do something this dumb. I hope you're proud."
