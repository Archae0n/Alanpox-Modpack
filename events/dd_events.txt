# deep dwellers lose the growth malus and size malus of cave dwellers but in return gain a new malus
# their empire suffers +100% size from planets and +150% size from systems and branch offices
# they do however gain +20% max districts.
# in addition, the pops suffer -15% growth from immigration and +25% resettlement cost, and their habitability floor is reduced to just 25%
